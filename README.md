# TavyzaOS

This branch (TavyzaOS) is a new generation of TherOS, as a distribution of Cobalt.
During the development period, expect heaps of issues and missing features. Please report all bugs to the issue tracker.

## PLANNED FEATURES:
- An editor
- Installer
- GUI
- Tiling window manager 
- Port a load of programs over (of course all the TherOS apps, aswell as snake)

To install: (in the future)
- Get a floppy disk
- Run the installer, select said floppy disk
- Reboot to the floppy disk
- You should be in a live environment. Run the installer
- Wipe whatever drive you'd like to use
- Install
- Done!

for the time being, internet is not part of the goals. Any TherOS system will need to be updated via floppy disk.
