-- TherOS 1.0.0 --
CHANGELOG

ADDED
- merged file creator and file manager into 1 app
- you can now create directories in the file manager

PLANNED for 1.0.0
- make a new init.lua and start shifting away from OpenOS
- add configuration to the installation process
- make settings menu
- make a whole load of libraries
- auto update detection (the installer would be able to check for updates from github)

-- make sure to put suggestions of what you want to see in the Github issues page! --

Note that i am not spending much of my time on updating TherOS. Do not expect quick updates.
