|==========================================|

- Now a proper release!!! This release brings to the main branch:

-- ADDED --
- Scrolling in file manager
- The option to open a terminal from the new file/directory menu
- Window borders
- Configuration
- Some fancy new libraries
- Maybe installing programs from floppy? Added but not tested
- Uptime to main menu

-- FIXED/CHANGED --
- A better therboot
- Error handling
- Apps in main menu are sorted

-- REMOVED --
- old installer directory in github

Planned: No new apps will be created until a window manager is set up. I will have to port existing programs. Please check the project linked with TherOS for context.

-- PLEASE RE-INSTALL/UPDATE INSTALLER TO INSTALL EVERYTHING IN NEW VERSIONS --

-- make sure to put suggestions of what you want to see in the Github issues page! --

Note that i am not spending much of my time on updating TherOS. Do not expect quick updates.
